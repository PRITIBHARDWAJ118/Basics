# Basic C++ Programs
## AIM: This repository contains to  download VS Code and contains simple C++ programs that serve as an introduction to the basics of C++ programming.  The programs included are:
1. Hello World
2. Input from User
3. Basic Calculator

## Theory:
###VS Code: 
We went to the official website [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) to download Visual Studio Code. Click "Download," choose your operating system, and launch the installation. After following the setup instructions, VS Code will be installed on your computer and available for coding with a wide range of features and extensions.
### Hello world:
 It is the utmost basic program in any language where we just print "Hello world". The most basic program that novices construct while learning a new programming language is a straightforward C++ "Hello World" application. It shows how to use the main() function, include libraries, and send output to the console, among other fundamental C++ syntax examples. The program's starting point is the main() method, when text is normally shown on the screen using the std::cout stream object.
 1. #include <iostream>-To include input/output operations in C++.
 2. using namespace std: It  simplifies code by eliminating the need to prefix standard library functions, like `std::cout` or `std::cin`.
 3. int main()- The main function where the execution of the program begins.
 4. cout<<"Hello World" : cout is the basic opeartion to print anything to the console. Here, it is printing "Hello World" to the console.
 5. return 0: Indicates that the program executed successfully.
### Getting input from the user:
The cin object, which reads input from the standard input stream—typically the keyboard—is provided by C++ to facilitate input from user. A program can ask the user to input data, such strings or integers, by using cin.
1. int a- this declares 'a' as a integer type data type. 
### Basic calculator:
A basic calculator program in C++ performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program typically takes two numbers as input from the user and then performs the desired arithmetic operations. The results of these operations are then displayed to the user. This kind of program introduces fundamental concepts like user input, basic arithmetic operations, and output. It uses cin object to take input and then cout object uses to show the output such as addition,subtraction,division and multiplication.

### Output: 
The output of the basic codes are:
